Find the missing element from an ordered array arr[], consisting of N elements representing an Arithmetic Progression(AP).

Note: There always exists an element which upon inserting into sequence forms Arithmetic progression. Boundary elements (first and last elements) are not missing.









class Solution {
    int findMissing(int[] arr, int n) {
        // code here
        int value =0;
        int diff = (arr[n-1] - arr[0])/n; 
        for(int i = 0; i<arr.length-1; i++){
            if(arr[i+1] - arr[i] != diff){
                value =  arr[i] + diff;
            }
        }
        return value;
    }
}
