Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6
Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: After reversing the list, 
elements are 6->5->4->3->2->1.







class Solution
{
    //Function to reverse a linked list.
    Node reverseList(Node head)
    {
     Node newHead = null;
    while (head != null) {
        Node next = head.next;
        head.next = newHead;
        newHead = head;
        head = next;
    }
    return newHead;
        
    }
}
