Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.




class Solution
{
    //Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public static int getCount(Node head)
    {
        
        //Code here
        int count=0;
        Node curr = head;
        while(curr != null){
            curr = curr.next;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
